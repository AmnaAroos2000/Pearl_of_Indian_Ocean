            The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to
             the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.Between 1988 and 2006 the province was temporarily 
             merged with the Eastern Province to form the North Eastern Province. The capital of the province is Jaffna. The majority
