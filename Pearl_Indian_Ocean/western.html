            The Western province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country.
             The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment 
             to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.[4][5] The province is the most densely populated province 
             in the country and is home to the legislative capital Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte as well to Colombo, the nation's administrative 
             and business center.

        <h2>Galle Face (Colombo District)</h2>
            <img class="pic20" src="galle.jpg">
            <p>This large, oceanfront park area is where many Sri Lankans go to play on the beach. The park is between Galle Road
                 and the Indian Ocean, right in the heart of Colombo next to the Fort area.Galle Face is a 5 ha (12 acres) ocean-side
                  urban park, which stretches for 500 m (1,600 ft) along the coast, in the heart of Colombo, the financial and business 
                  capital of Sri Lanka. The promenade was initially laid out in 1859 by Governor Sir Henry George Ward, although the original 
                  Galle Face Green extended over a much larger area than is seen today.

                It's the largest open space in the city and has 500 meters of beach, along with a beachfront promenade filled with vendors.
                 Colombo's hot sunshine means this is also a popular area for night fun - Saturday and Sunday nights are the best times to visit.
                
                You can wade in the water, picnic on the beach, or fly a kite in the ever-present wind. It's a fun place for families,
                 and it's also good for running.

                <h2>National Museum of Colombo (Colombo District)</h2>
                <img class="pic21" src="musm.jpg">
                <p>The National Museum of Colombo, also called the Sri Lanka National Museum, is the official museum of Sri Lanka and
                     takes you on a journey over the thousands of years of Sri Lankan culture. It's one of those museums that has multiple
                      types of media, from artwork to artifacts, as well as clothing, jewelry, coins, arms, and craftwork. The displays 
                      show both the cultural and natural heritage of the country, presented chronologically, starting with pre-history and
                       leading to the present day.

                    Give yourself a few hours to fully explore the collections. The museum is housed in a grand Victorian colonial building
                     in central Colombo near Viharamahadevi Park.The Information Technology division of National Museum of Sri Lanka is used
                      to archive the all the data in the Museum and save it in a safe form. It also takes care of online queries and maintaining
                       the museum web page.</p>

                       <h2> Richmond Castle (Kalutara District)</h2>
                       <img class="pic23" src="csl.jpg">
                       <p>Located nearby the Kalutara city, historic Edwardian mansion, Richmond Castle is a worth visiting place in Sri Lanka.
                            It took 10 years from 1900 to 1910 that this popular mansion was built to finally become the seat of the Mudaliyar
                             Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena for administrative purpose. Today it remains one of the select few major 
                             tourist destinations in this region. This two-story building has 16 rooms whose 34 windows and 99 doors appeal to all visitors. 
                             As a Sri Lankan architectural marvel, its construction remained unique. Its essential stuff had been imported from various countries 
                             that included its Italian floor titles; Burmese teaks grape vines to glass d√©cors from Scotland and bathroom fittings to iron stairs 
                             from England to name a few. This tourist spot is highly rushed nowadays.</p>
