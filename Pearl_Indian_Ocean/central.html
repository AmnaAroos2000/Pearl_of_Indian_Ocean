            The Central Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. 
            The Central Province is primarily in the central mountainous terrain of Sri Lanka. It is the 6th largest province by area 
            and is home to 2.5 million people. It is bordered by North Central Province to the north, Uva Province to the east, 
            North Western Province to the west and Sabaragamuwa Province to the south and west. The province's capital is Kandy.
            The cities of Matale and Nuwara Eliya are in the Central Province. The province is famous for its production of Ceylon tea,
            planted by the British in the 1860s after a devastating disease killed all the coffee plantations in the province.
             The Central Province attracts many tourists, with hill station towns such as Gampola, Hatton and Nuwara Eliya

        <img class="pic1" src="dm.jpg">
        <P class="para1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considered as one of the most important temples of Buddhists in Sri Lanka, the Temple of Tooth Relic is 
            located to the north of Kandy Lake and is one of the most remarkable places to visit in Kandy Sri Lanka. The sacred tooth of 
            Lord Buddha enshrined in the temple makes it one of the popular Kandy tourist places. The room housing the tooth is open to devotees
             to offer their prayers. However, nobody gets to see the tooth because it is kept in a golden casket inside a stupa-like structure.
              The temple is housed in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy. One of the best places to see in Kandy, this temple
               is of great importance due to the belief of the country on the tooth. The temple has rituals thrice a day.
             The temple was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site 1988. The temple still stands strong even after facing attacks twice.</P>
       
         
                
                <h2 class="top2">Sigiriya (Matale District)</h2>
                <img class="pic2" src="sig.jpg">
                <p class="para2">Sigiriya or Sinhagiri is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the
                     Central Province, Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive 
                     column of rock around 180 metres (590 ft) high.[2]

                    According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Culavamsa, this area was a large forest, then after storms and 
                    landslides it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (477 – 495 AD) for his new capital. He built his palace
                     on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of 
                     this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this
                      structure — Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock (an etymology similar to Sinhapura, the Sanskrit name of Singapore, the Lion City).
                    
                    The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until 
                    
                    the 14th century.[3] Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of a

                <h2 class="top3">World's End (Nuwara Eliya District)</h2>
                <img class="pic3" src="end.jpg">
                <p class="para3">World's End is located within the Horton Plains National Park in Nuwara Eliya District, Sri Lanka.
                    Meaning that this is the place which has the highest gap in Sri Lanka.  It is a sheer cliff. It is one of the most visited
                    parts of the Park, and a key tourist attraction in the Nuwara Eliya District and the country at large. This place highlights 
                    the rich bio-diversity of Sri Lanka. This is a trail with remarkable diversity of terrain, weather, vegetation etc.
                     It starts off with a stretch across the beautiful paddy fields. Climb through pines plots, grass lands, Montana forest patches, 
                     tea estates and finally through a cloud forest to reach Worlds End. One can view the town of Balangoda which is located way below 
                     your point of observation. Walk alone through the silent plain of Horton plain to the end of the world. Stand 2000 Metres high at
                      the edge of the cold frosted grass land and lower your eyes towards the next land mark - the tea plantations 900 Meters below.
                       Gaze onward beyond the waves of mountains, filigree of water falls, hazy lakes and paddy fields to the pink salters of Hambantota 
                       and shining sea in a horizontal sweep.
