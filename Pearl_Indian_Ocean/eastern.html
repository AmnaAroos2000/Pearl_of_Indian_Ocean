        <p>The Eastern Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country.
             The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment 
             to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.[4][5] Between 1988 and 2006 the province was temporarily
              merged with the Northern Province to form the North Eastern Province. The capital of the province is Trincomalee.
              Eastern province has an area of 9,996 square kilometres (3,859 sq mi).[1]

              The province is surrounded by the Northern Province to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Southern Province 
              to the south, and the Uva, Central and North Central provinces to the west.
              
              The province's coast is dominated by lagoons, the largest being Batticaloa Lagoon, Kokkilai lagoon, Upaar Lagoon 
              and Ullackalie Lagoon.</p>

            <h2>
                Natural Habour (Trincomalee District)
            </h2>
            <img class="pic4" src="hbr.jpg">
            <p>
                Trincomalee Harbour is a seaport in Trincomalee Bay or Koddiyar Bay, 
                a large natural harbour situated on the northeastern coast of Sri Lanka.

                Located by Trincomalee, Sri Lanka, in the heart of the Indian Ocean, its 
                strategic importance has shaped its history. There have been many sea battles to 
                control the harbour. The Portuguese, Dutch, French, and the British have each held it in turn. In 
                1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Trincomalee harbour and sank three British warships anchored there.
                The harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world, is overlooked by terraced highlands, and its
                 entrance is guarded by two headlands. The harbour has 1630 hectares of water, while the entrance channel is 
                 500 metres wide. The bay includes the first of a number submarine canyons, making Trincomalee one of the finest
                  deep-sea harbours in the world.
            </p>
        
        
            <h2>Marbel Beach (Trincomalee District)</h2>

       
        <img class="pic5" src="mrbl.jpg">
        <p>Marble Beach, also known as Marble Bay Beach, is another fine beach in Sri Lanka. 
            The beach is situated at the Marble Bay that comes within the Trincomalee’s natural harbor area. 
            When the day is bright and the sea is calm, you can see the surface shining like a marble and that’s how the name is derived.
            The Marble Bay Beach is popular for snorkeling and diving in Trincomalee. The famous Marble Beach resort is located here. 
            However, the highlight of the beach is its fine sand and the sightings of peacocks, monkeys and cattle along with a variety of birds.

            For the lazy visitor, the sands are perfect for spending a few hours at the beach getting a sun-kissed tan. 
            When here, don’t forget to visit the nearby ‘Diamond Hill’ that offers a fabulous view of the city.</p>
        
            <h2>Kumana National Park (Ampara District)</h2>
            <img class="pic6" src="dr.jpg">
            <p>
                Kumana National Park in Sri Lanka is renowned for its avifauna, particularly its large flocks of migratory
                 waterfowl and wading birds. The park is 391 kilometres (243 mi) southeast of Colombo on Sri Lanka's southeastern coast.
                  Kumana is contiguous with Yala National Park.
                 Kumana was formerly known as Yala East National Park, but changed to its present name on 5 September 2006.KUMANA 
                 (YALA EAST) NATIONAL PARK is a well-known eco tourism attraction and bird sanctuary where a multitude of birds breed and roost. 
                 One of the most significant features of the park is the 'Kumana Villu' - a 200 hectare natural swamp lake, fed by the 'Kumbukkan Oya' 
                 through a half mile long narrow channel. It is at this mangrove swamp that many water birds nest in May and June. Regular sightings 
                 include such species of bird as pelicans, painted storks, spoonbills, white ibis, herons, egrets and little cormorants.

                 The very rare black-necked stork has also been spotted at the swamp. Besides the prolific birdlife, Kumana is also home to 
                 some of the mammals found in the larger YALA NATIONAL PARK (west) park, such as elephants and leopards. The vegetation in Kumana 
                 consists mainly of mangrove trees, kumbuk trees and the karan fern, as well as the open marsh area. For bird watching enthusiasts, 
                 the park is an 'absolute must'.
