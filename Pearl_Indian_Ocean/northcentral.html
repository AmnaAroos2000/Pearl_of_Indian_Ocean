        North Central Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country.
         The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to 
         the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils. The province is the largest by size, and second least 
         populated in the country. The province consists of the districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, both of which were important
          ancient Sri Lankan kingdoms. The climate is semi-arid, and the forests are dry evergreen forests.

   <h2>Ruwanvelisaya (Anuradhapura District)</h2>
        <img class="pic7" src="run.jpg">
        <p>The Ruwanweliseya stupa is one of the largest stupas or dagobas, which is in the heart of the beautiful heritage 
            city of Anuradhapura. This magnificent stupa was built by King Dutugamunu, who was hailed to be the hero of the island. 
            The Ruwanweliseya stupa is also known as the Maha stupa and is one of the most adorned structures of the people of Sri Lanka.

            Today the Ruwanweliseya stupa stands tall with a height of 338 feet and a diameter of 951 ft. The stupa is surrounded 
            by large paved courts and platforms which add to the beauty of the place. Initially, on the outer side of the boundary of 
            the wall is a complete circle of elephants, made out of the brickwork. Till today, there are many renovations which have 
            taken place from time which has made the Ruwanweliseya stupa is one of the most revered and influential areas of worship 
            for the Buddhists in Anuradhapura.</p>

            <h2>Parakkirama Samudra (Polannaruwa District)</h2>
            <img class="pic8" src="sam.jpg">
            <p>
                Parakrama Samudra (or King Parakrama's sea or the Sea of King Parakrama) is a shallow reservoir (wewa), consisting 
                of five separate wewa (reservoirs) (thopa, dumbutulu, erabadu, bhu, kalahagala tanks) connected by narrow channels 
                in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka.

                The northernmost reservoir is the oldest and referred to as Topa wewa (Sinhalese wewa is almost equal to English 
                word lake or reservoir, but used unique Sri Lankan technology) built around 386 AD. The middle section Eramudu wewa
                 and the southernmost portion, at the highest elevation, is Dumbutula wewa, both sections were added and the reservoir 
                 expanded during the reign of King Parâkramabâhu I.[1] This wewa (reservoir) was built under the quote "do not let even
                  a drop of rain water in this country to go to the sea without use". The wewa (reservoir) was so large it was called 
                  samudhraya or ocean but there was another reason it was called that due to the wind we know that waves erupt in tanks, 
                  parakrama samudhraya was so large the waves come as big as the ocean waves.
