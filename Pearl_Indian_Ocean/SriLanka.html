    <h1 id="one">Introduction</h1>
    <p id="two">Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, just off the southeastern coast of India. 
        Despite its modest size—slightly larger than the state of West Virginia—Sri Lanka has a population of 
        about 20 million people, almost equal to the population of Texas. The island is rich in natural resources, 
        and has a diverse economy based on agriculture, mining, fishing, manufacturing, and tourism. On becoming an
         independent nation in 1948 Sri Lanka (formerly called Ceylon) seemed to be headed for a future as a stable 
         and prosperous democracy. Since the 1970s, however, the country has been torn by violent struggles between 
         the two main ethnic groups, Sinhalese and Tamils, that make up its population. Sri Lanka suffered severe damage
          and loss of life from the tsunami of 2004; what effect that disaster will have on the country’s political future remains to be seen.</p>
          <h1 id="three">Breif History of Sri Lanka</h1>
          <img class="ab" src="province.JPG">
          <p id="four">Sri Lanka was known from the beginning of British colonial rule as Ceylon, US also /seɪˈlɒn/). A nationalist
              litical movement arose in the country in the early 20th century to obtain political independence, which was 
              granted in 1948; the country became a republic and adopted its current name in 1972. Sri Lanka's recent
              
              history has been marred by a 26-year civil war, which decisively ended when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces 
              defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2009.

            After years of agitation, Ceylon was granted independence in 1948. However, conflicts between Sinhalese, 
            Tamils, Muslims and Christians continues. In 1972, Ceylon became a democratic socialists republic, and the 
            name Sri Lanka was chosen to replace Ceylon. The current constitution stipulates the political system as a 
            
            republic and a unitary state governed by a semi-presidential system. It has had a long history of international
            
            engagement. Along with the Maldives, Sri Lanka is one of only two South Asian countries rated high on the Human 
            
            Development Index , with its rating and per capita income the highest among South Asian nations. The Sri Lankan 
            constitution accords Buddhism the foremost place, although it does not identify it as a state religion. Buddhism 
            is given special privileges in the Sri Lankan constitution.
            
            The island is home to many cultures, languages and ethnicities. The majority of the population is from the
             Sinhalese ethnicity, while a large minority of Tamils have also played an influential role in the island's 
             history. Moors, Burghers, Malays, Chinese, and the indigenous Vedda are also established groups on the island</p>
             <h1 id="five">Geographical Features</h1>
             
             <p id="six">Shaped like a teardrop, the island of Sri Lanka measures about 255 miles (415 km.) from north to south, and
                  about 135 miles (220 km.) from east to west, with a total land area of about 25,300 square miles
                   (65,600 square km.). It has more than 830 miles (1340 km.) of coastline. The island is ringed by a 
                   broad coastal plain, rising to an inland terrain of gently rolling hills. A range of mountains dominates the
                    south-central interior, with the highest peak, Mt. Piduruthalagala, reaching more than 8200 feet (2524 meters)
                    height.

                Located between 5 and 10 degrees latitude north of the equator, Sri Lanka has a tropical 
                 dominated by two monsoon seasons. The summer monsoon lasts from mid-May to October, when winds 
                 from the southwest bring rain from the Indian Ocean to the southern and western parts of the island. 
                 During the winter monsoon, from December through March, winds from the northeast bring rain from the Bay 
                 of Bengal to northern and eastern regions. Monsoon rains are constant and heavy, with up to 100 inches of rain 
                 per month falling during the summer monsoon in the southwest. October-November and mid-March to mid-May are 
                 intermonsoon seasons, with less rainfall. The climate is hot and humid for much of the year, but is cooler in
                  the highlands.</p>
                  <h1 id="seven">Cultures</h1>
                  <img class="ef" src="cult.jpg">
                  <p id="eight">The culture of Sri Lanka has been influenced by many factors but has managed to retain much of its 
                      ancient aspects. Mostly it has been influenced by its long history and its Buddhist heritage. The 
                      
                      country has a rich artistic tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual 
                      arts. Sri Lankan lifestyle is reflected in the cuisine, festivals, and sports. South Indian influences 
                      are visible in many aspects. There are some influences from colonisation by the Portuguese, the Dutch, 
                      and the British. Sri Lankan culture is best known abroad for its cricket, food, holistic medicine, religious 
                      icons like the Buddhist flag, and cultural exports such as tea, cinnamon and gems. Sri Lankan culture is diverse, 
                      as it varies from region to region.

 

                    Sri Lanka has had ties with Indian subcontinent from ancient times. Demographics: Sinhalese 74.8%,
                     Sri Lankan Moors 9.23%, Indian Tamil 4.16%, Sri Lankan Tamil 11.21%, Other 0.6%.
                    
                     
                    
                    Sri Lanka boasts of a documented history of over 2000 years mainly due to ancient historic scriptures
                     like Mahawansa. Several centuries of intermittent foreign influence, has transformed Sri Lankan 
                     culture to the present outlook. Nevertheless ancient traditions and festivals are celebrated by 
                     mostly conservative Sinhalese people of the island, together with other minorities that make up the 
                     Sri Lankan identity.</p>
                     <h1 id="nine">Economy</h1>
                     <img class="cd" src="eco.jpg">
                     <p id="ten">The free-market economy of Sri Lanka was worth $84 billion by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) 
                         in 2019[26] and $296.959 billion by purchasing power parity (PPP).[27] The country had experienced
                          an annual growth of 6.4 percent from 2003 to 2012, well above its regional peers. This growth was 
                          driven by the growth of non-tradable sectors, which the World Bank warned to be both unsustainable 
                          and unequitable. Growth has slowed since then. In 2019 with an income per capita of 13,620 PPP 
                          Dollars[28] or 3,852 (2019) nominal US dollars,[29][30] Sri Lanka was re-classified as a lower 
                          middle income nation by the World Bank from a previous upper middle income status.Services accounted 
                          for 58.2% of Sri Lanka's economy in 2019 up from 54.6% in 2010, industry 27.4% up from 26.4% a decade 
                          earlier and agriculture 7.4%.[8] Though there is a competitive export agricultural sector, technological 
                          advances have been slow to enter the protected domestic sector.[33] Sri Lanka is the largest solid and industrial 
                          tyres manufacturing centre in the world and has an apparel sector which is moving up the value chain.[34] But rising
                           trade protection over the past decade has also caused concern over the resurgence of inward looking policie</p>

                           <img class="hi" src="tourist.jpg">
                           <p id="twelve">Sri Lanka is one of the most popular tourist destinations because it contains a mixture of unique wild life,
                                golden beaches, a rich cultural heritage and amazing landscapes. Thousands of tourists visit Sri Lanka annually.

                            There are many wildlife parks such as Yala, Wilpattu and Kumana. Tourists like to watch wild animals wandering 
                            in their natural surroundings.
                            
                            The sandy beach is also another attraction, Sri Lanka has. Many tourists spend their holidays swimming, diving 
                            and sailing here.
                            
                            Sri Lanka has a heritage of over 2,500 years. Ancient ruins can be seen in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya
                             and Yapahuwa. Tourists stop over to see wonderful creations, paintings and ruins of great buildings and monuments.
                            
                            There are attractive waterfalls in Sri Lanka such as Dunhinda, Diyaluma and Bambarakanda. Dunhinda is the most 
                            beautiful, while Bambarakanda is the tallest waterfall. Tourists never fail to visit these places.
                            
                            The Botanical Gardens at Peradeniya and Haggala attract many tourists. More tourists come to Sri Lanka to
                             visit these attractive places.
                            
                            Further, the hot water wells in Kanniya, the World’s End in Nuwara Eliya and the natural harbour in Trincomalee
                             are some of the attractive places tourists visit. So, we can be proud of the beauty of our country.
