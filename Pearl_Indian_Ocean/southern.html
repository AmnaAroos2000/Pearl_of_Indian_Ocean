            The Southern Province of Sri Lanka is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of 
            the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th
             Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.[3][4] It is the 7th largest province by area 
             and is home to 2.5 million people, the 3rd most populated province. The province is bordered by Sabaragamuwa Province and
              Uva Province to the North, Eastern Province to the Northeast, Western Province to the Northwest and the Indian Ocean to 
              the South, West and East. The Province's capital is Galle.

            <h2>Galle Fort (Galle District)</h2>
            <img class="pic28" src="gl.jpg">
            <p>Galle Fort in the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese, 
                then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. It is a historical, archaeological
                 and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 432 years maintains a polished appearance, due to extensive
                  reconstruction work done by Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.

                The fort has a colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population.
                 The Sri Lankan government and many Dutch people who still own some of the properties inside the fort are
                 
                 looking at making this one of the modern wonders of the world.[4][5] The heritage value of the fort has been 
                 recognized by the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site under 
                 criteria iv, for its unique exposition of "an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture
                  and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries."[3]
                
                The Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle", withstood the Boxing Day tsunami 
                which damaged part of coastal area Galle town. It has been since restored</p>

                      having been designated in 1938. The park is best known for its variety of wild animals. It is important for the conservation
                       of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds.

                        <img class="31" src="light.jpg">

                            The name Dondra is a synonym for "Devi-Nuwara" in the local Sinhala language, "Devi" meaning "Gods" and "Nuwara"
                             meaning "City". Dondra is therefore derived to mean "City of the Gods".</p>
