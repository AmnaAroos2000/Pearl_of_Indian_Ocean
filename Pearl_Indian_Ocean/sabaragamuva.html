        <p>The Sabaragamuwa Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country.
             The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to
              the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils. The Sabaragamuwa Province contains two districts: 
              Ratnapura and Kegalle. It is named after its former indigenous inhabitants, namely the Sabara, an indic term for hunter-
              gatherer tribes, a term seldom used in ancient Sri Lanka.</p>

        <h2>Sinharaja Forest Reserve (Ratnapura District)</h2>
            <img class="pic32" src="sin.jpg">
            <p>Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is of international significance
                 and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[1]

                According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of 
                primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. 50% of Sri 
                Lankan's endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species). It is home to 
                95% endemic birds.
                
                The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial
                 logging by its inaccessibility, and was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.
                
                Because of the dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as at dry-zone national parks such as Yala. 
                There are about 3 elephants, and 15 or so[vague] leopards. The most common larger mammal is the endemic purple-faced langur.
                
                Birds tend to move in mixed feeding flocks, invariably led by the fearless Sri Lanka Crested Drongo and the noisy
                 orange-billed babbler. Of Sri Lanka's 26 endemic birds, the 20 rainforest species all occur here, including the elusive
                  red-faced malkoha, green-billed coucal and Sri Lanka blue magpie.
                
                Reptiles include the endemic green pit viper and hump-nosed vipers, and there are a large variety of amphibians,
                 especially tree frogs. Invertebrates include the endemic Sri Lankan birdwing butterfly and leeches.</p>
                 
                <h2>Adam's Peak (Ratnapura District)</h2>
                 <img class="pic33" src="adam.jpg">
                 <p>Adam's Peak is a 2,243 m (7,359 ft) tall conical mountain located in central Sri Lanka.
                      It is well known for the Sri Pada "sacred footprint", a 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) rock formation near the summit, 
                      which in Buddhist tradition is held to be the footprint of the Buddha, in Hindu tradition that of Hanuman or Shiva 
                    "Mountain of Shiva's Light", and in some Islamic and Christian traditions that of Adam, or that of St. ThomasDue to its significance to the various people that inhabit the country, the mountain is referred to by a variety of names.

                    The often used Sri Pada is derived from Sanskrit, used by the Sinhalese people in a religious context; this name also has 
                    meaning in PƒÅli, and may be translated roughly as "the sacred foot". It refers to the footprint-shaped mark at the summit, 
                    
                    which is believed by Buddhists to be that of the Buddha. Christian and Islamic traditions assert that it is the footprint 
                    of Adam, left when first setting foot on Earth after having been cast out of paradise, giving it the name "Adam's Peak</p>
