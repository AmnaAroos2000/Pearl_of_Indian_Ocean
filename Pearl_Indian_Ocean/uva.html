        <p>Uva Province is Sri Lanka's second least populated province, with 1,259,880 people, created in 1896.
             It consists of two districts: Badulla and Moneragala. The provincial capital is Badulla. Uva is bordered 
             by the Eastern, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, and Central provinces. Its major tourist attractions are Dunhinda falls,
              Diyaluma Falls, Rawana Falls, the Yala National Park (lying partly in the Southern and Eastern Provinces) 
              and Gal Oya National Park (lying partly in the Eastern Province). The Gal Oya hills and the Central mountains
               are the main uplands, while the Mahaweli (Sinhalese: great-sandy) and Menik (Sinhalese: gemstone) rivers and 
               the huge Senanayake Samudraya and Maduru Oya Reservoirs are the major waterways</p>

        <h2>Dunhinda Waterfall (Badulla District)</h2>
            <img class="pic25" src="dun.jpg">
            <p>Nature lovers and all those tourists wanting to explore some adventure won’t miss the 64-meters high Dunhinda
                 Falls waterfall in Badulla, Sri Lanka. As this popular fall is located at a distance of fewer than 5 kilometers 
                 from the city area, tourists plan their visits at ease. Famous amongst all Sri Lankan waterfalls, this waterfall 
                 has gained immense popularity. In fact, it is also mentioned in some of the literary works. Local and international
                  travelers ensure that Dunhinda Falls are added in their itineraries. It won’t be wrong to say that a Sri Lankan tour
                   will remain incomplete without visiting this beautiful waterfall.</p>

                   <h2>Kataragama Devalaya (Moneragala District)</h2>
                   <img class="pic26" src="kat.jpg">
                   <p>Dedicating the Sinhalese deity Kataragama Deviyo, popular Sri Lankan ancient temple of Kataragama Devalaya remains 
                       a must visit the site in Badulla nowadays. It is historically important location that also reminds the golden past
                        of this area. The temple site is enlisted into the Archeologically Protected Monuments list. History lovers find 
                      much to explore here and know more about this region’s past. Although the exact construction date is still unknown,
                     some historians claim that it exists since the 17th century while the regional King Vimaladharmasuriya I 
                      ruled the Kingdom of Kandy to build this Devalaya. The Pilimageya or worshippers’ spot as shrine room is a most
                     visited place inside this monument. Rich architecture of this monument through the carved timber columns the presence
                      of Kandyan era paintings make it worth exploring place during a Sri Lankan tour.</p>
